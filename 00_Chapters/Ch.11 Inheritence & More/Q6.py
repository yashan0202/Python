In the previous question , write __str__() method to print the vector as follow:

7i + 8j + 10k (Assume that its a 3D vector).

class Vector:

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.x}i + {self.y}j + {self.z}k"  #only this line is changed
    
# Test the implementation
v1 = Vector(1, 2, 3)
v2 = Vector(4, 5, 6)
v3 = Vector(7, 8, 9)

print(v1 + v2) 
print(v1 * v2)
